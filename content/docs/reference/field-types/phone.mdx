## Answer Structure

```json
{
  "phone": "+919876543210"
}
```

## Example

### Basic Phone
```json

  "phone": {

    "type": "string",
    "description": "phone",
    "accessMatrix": {
      "mandatory": true
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "phone": {
    "title": "Mobile Number",
    "type": "string",
    "description": "phone",
    "pattern": "^\\+91[0-9]{10}$",
    "validationMessage": "Enter valid Indian mobile number (+91XXXXXXXXXX)"
  }
}
```
